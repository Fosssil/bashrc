# bashrc
Just a file(bashrc) to change your bash terminal's configuration on linux
Note: This script is for KDE NEON users only. In future I will oher distributions also.
There is noting much hypocratic just a bunch of custom made 'alias' commands to type less.

Installation Guide:
1. Move the .bashrc file from the current location to home folder and happy happy linuxing.
